Simple ratios for CSS.

```
<div class='SOMETHING-WITH-WIDTH'> <!-- this outside div should have a width specifier -->
	<div class='ratio-wrapper-WIDE-HIGH'> <!-- WIDE and HIGH are ratios from 1 to 16 e.g. '3-4' -->
		<div class='ration-wrapper-inner'> <!-- required -->
			<div>Content</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

```
